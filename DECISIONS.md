# DECISIONS.md — Linen Earth

Architecture and product decisions that must persist across coding sessions.

## 2026-10-01 — Adopt Execution Roadmap v2 by adaptation, not rewrite
**Decision:** keep the existing application and map Roadmap v2 onto it. Rebuild only modules that fail the new gates.

**Why:** the current repository already contains the Designer, Analyzer, Style Director foundations, measurements integration, CI, FASHN final-render flow, operator workflows and Supabase migrations. Starting again would discard validated work.

## 2026-10-01 — True-scale preview is the next core gate
**Decision:** the next major engineering proof is the premium shirt preview with measurable physical pattern scale.

**Why:** current preview work is deterministic and much more advanced than a simple colour overlay, but the roadmap's core promise requires repeatable proof that a known stripe / repeat is rendered at the declared physical scale on the garment.

**Rule:** do not market an unverified preview as physically exact. Continue to show approximate / verified scale states from evidence.

## 2026-10-01 — Keep deterministic editing; AI only for final / edge tasks
**Decision:** instant garment-option editing must stay local / deterministic. FASHN remains a final photoreal rendering step, not the live editor.

## 2026-10-01 — Keep advanced garments, hide behind readiness where necessary
**Decision:** do not delete trousers, blazers, suits or the existing wear-type intelligence. If the shirt flow is not yet at the new proof standard, gate less mature garment flows with feature flags or readiness labels rather than removing them.

## 2026-10-01 — Brand spelling
**Decision:** customer-facing brand is **Linen Earth**. New work should use that spelling unless preserving a legacy technical identifier that would break compatibility.

## 2026-10-01 — Durable customer state before public order reliance
**Decision:** browser-only drafts may remain as convenience, but customer-critical designs / measurement profiles / enquiries must have durable server persistence before they are relied on operationally.

## 2026-10-02 — Customer Designer stays photo-first
**Decision:** the photographic studio model is the canonical customer preview in Designer. The flat/vector construction study must not be exposed as an alternate customer-facing model.

**Why:** the premium target is believable fabric on a consistent photographed model. Construction geometry may remain an internal engineering/QA aid, but customer preview should not fall back to a cartoon-like figure.


## 2026-10-02 — Engineering complete is not roadmap complete
**Decision:** a Roadmap v2 phase is only labelled complete when both its engineering contract and its documented real-world evidence gate pass.

**Why:** several phases depend on physical cloth measurements, independent users, tailor checks, render review or real production outcomes that code cannot manufacture.

**Rule:** missing evidence stays open in the Roadmap Readiness control tower. Do not invent thresholds simply to turn a phase green; Phase 2 physical-field coverage remains open until the owner/supplier policy is explicitly documented.

## 2026-10-02 — Fabric Truth thresholds are human-defined
**Decision:** Phase 2 physical evidence coverage for pattern scale, GSM, drape and fibre is controlled by an explicit owner/supplier policy stored in the operator evidence ledger.

**Why:** software cannot decide what proportion of the active catalogue must carry supplier documents or physical roll measurements before Linen Earth treats the evidence base as operationally sufficient.

**Rule:** only an approved, named human policy may satisfy the physical-coverage portion of Phase 2. A review-state policy, missing policy, or model-inferred physical fact cannot complete the gate. The 50 reviewed-fabric target and controlled physical-colour gate remain separate requirements.

## 2026-10-02 — Launch readiness verifies the live backend
**Decision:** Phase 9 must verify the hardened Roadmap v2 capability contract against the live production Supabase database, not only against migration files in Git.

**Why:** a green repository can still be operationally stale if production migrations were not applied. The production evidence RPC is therefore part of the launch gate.

**Rule:** if the backend health RPC is missing, unavailable, or reports any required capability absent, Phase 9 stays evidence-open. The check is read-only and cannot manufacture evidence.

## 2026-10-02 — Production Vercel builds are main-only
**Decision:** automatic Vercel Git deployments are disabled for every branch except `main`. GitHub CI is the default verifier for feature branches; Vercel preview deployments are no longer created automatically.

**Why:** repeated feature-branch pushes exhausted the Vercel deployment rate limit and blocked a valid production milestone from deploying.

**Rule:** the primary project continues only on `main`; duplicate Vercel projects remain ignored by the existing project-ID guard. Create a preview deliberately only when visual/runtime verification needs one.

## 2026-10-02 — Photographic garment edges feather inward
**Decision:** customer-facing fabric, collar, cuff and creative-surface clipping uses inward-only feathered photographic masks rather than hard vector edges.

**Why:** hard path clipping makes otherwise photographic fabric read like a sticker pasted onto the model, especially beside the neck, cuffs and hands.

**Rule:** edge softness may exist only inside the photographed garment silhouette. No feathering may spread fabric onto skin, hands, studio background or neighbouring garments. Flat construction styling stays outside the customer Designer.

## 2026-10-02 — Phase 9 verifies the primary production runtime
**Decision:** launch readiness must verify that the Operator control tower is running from the primary Linen Earth Vercel project in the production environment with an immutable deployment ID and Git commit SHA.

**Why:** repository CI and a healthy database do not by themselves prove that the customer-facing production runtime is the intended deployment. Duplicate linked Vercel projects must not satisfy the launch gate.

**Rule:** Phase 9 stays open on preview deployments, duplicate project IDs, missing deployment identity, missing production URL, or missing Git SHA. The check is read-only and uses Vercel system environment metadata.

## 2026-10-02 — Remaining Roadmap work is evidence-sprint driven
**Decision:** once an active Roadmap phase is engineering-complete, the next work is sequenced from the live evidence gates rather than adding speculative product code.

**Why:** the remaining blockers are primarily physical cloth checks, real users, tailor approval, render review and delivered production outcomes. More code cannot legitimately satisfy those gates.

**Rule:** the Evidence Sprint may prioritize and link real-world collection work, but it must never auto-create, duplicate, infer or promote evidence. Downstream production/outcome work stays later until its real dependencies pass.

## 2026-10-02 — Photographic structure is neutral-luminance
**Decision:** the instant photo compositor must preserve the studio photograph's folds, seams and wrinkles without reintroducing the source garment's original light/dark colour bias.

**Why:** using the raw dark source shirt as a fold layer can make a light selected Linen Earth fabric look artificially charcoal; using the raw pale source trousers can wash darker cloth out.

**Rule:** detail passes are luminance-normalized per photographed garment before blending. The fabric swatch remains the colour/texture source; the studio photo supplies structure and lighting only.
